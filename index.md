## About Me

Hi, I'm Boyuan, a first-year PhD student at The Ohio State University. I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/). Before that, I received my Bachelor degree in Software Engineering from Northeastern University (China) and Master degree in Computer Science from The Johns Hopkins University where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/).

**I am actively looking for research internship opportunities for 2024 summer.**

## Research Interests

I am interested in developing **language agents** that can free human beings from tedious tasks and assist with decision making, especially on web environments. 
I am also broadly interested in new directions and welcome new collaborations. Currently, I focus on the following directions:
- **Multimodality**
- **Grounding, Planing, and Reasoning**
- **Synthetic data**
- **Agent Safety**
